# Position Control CLI application

This project uses a MySQL database and Node.js to create a position control CLI application. In this application the user can perform all essential functions including viewing lists of existing employees, roles, and departments. User can also update an existing employee's role as well as add additional roles, departments, and employees into the database. 

The application also allows the user to delete departments from the database.
